  Description:
    Abstract:
      This feature dataset shows the distribution and extent of the bedrock geologic units within the State of Illinois, as depicted on the map Bedrock Geology of Illinois (2005) by D. Kolata (compiler), published by the Illinois State Geologic Survey.

      The component feature classes show geologic units (polygons) and faults (lines.)

      The nominal scale of the published hardcopy map is 1:500,000.  In some areas data of greater scale were generalized and incorporated.
    Purpose:
      This data set was compiled to replace/update the existing feature dataset (IL_Bedrock_Geology_500K_1967), based on the 1967 Willman et al. Geologic Map of Illinois.

      The data can be used for any project which requires bedrock data at a scale of 1:500,000.  This data should not be used at a scale larger than 1:500,000.  Not suitable for site specific work.

      The data are not appropriate as a geodetic, legal or engineering base.  The data set was not and is not intended as a substitute for surveyed locations, such as can be determined by a registered Public Land Surveyor.  Although useful in a GIS as a reference base layer for maps, the data set has no legal basis in the definition of boundaries or property lines.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: No report.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No report.
  Completeness_Report: This data set contains geologic units and fault lines as depicted on the source map.  There are many additional features on the source map that are not depicted in this digital data set, for example, geologic columns, cross-sections and other thematic insets.  Quaternary materials are not shown.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Data were compiled from areas mapped at difference scales.  Scale varies across the map.  Some source data were generalized.  The smallest scale of data used is 1:500,000, and that is the scale of the published map.  Geologic unit boundaries are approximate.
