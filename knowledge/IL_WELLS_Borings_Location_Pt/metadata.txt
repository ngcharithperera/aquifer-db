  Description:
    Abstract:
      This shapefile contains point locations from the ISGS Wells and Borings database.  The attribute information include API number (the ID), well or boring type, longitude, and latitude.  The spatial reference is geographic coordinates, decimal degrees, NAD83.

      The data are exported to a shapefile weekly from the Wells and Borings (source) database for Internet distribution.  The source database is updated daily.  Thus, there may be recent updates (last 7 days) in the source database that are not reflected in this shapefile.

      The data are primarily oil, gas and water wells, but also include other designations such as engineering boring, stratigraphic test hole, injection well, etc.

      The collection contains data for over 580,000 wells and borings, some dating back to 1801 (assumed.)  Most locations have not been field verified.

      The nominal scale is 1:62,500, however locations have been determined in several different ways at different scales.  Most commonly, the location is derived by converting a legal  (i.e. Public Land Survey Survey - PLSS) description to a point location.  The stated accuracy is +/- 100 feet, however some points may be inaccurate by as much as one mile due to irregularities in the Illinois PLSS and associated descriptions.  For legal descriptions that indicate only a PLSS section or quarter-section, the point is assumed to be in the center of the respective section or quarter-section.

      Additional detailed information about these wells and borings is available free of charge online at the Illinois State Geological Survey web site (http://www.isgs.illinois.edu/) in the ILOIL (oil and gas) and ILWATER (water and related wells) interactive map services.

      Bulk and special order data retrievals are also available for a fee as described in the Standard Order Process of the Distribution Information section.  Additional information may include owner, permit details, PLSS location, total depth, surface elevation, geologic formation and material description, driller's log, and down-hole logs.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended to provide a simple GIS-based portrayal of the distribution and type of wells and borings in Illinois.

      The data do not replace the need for detailed site-specific studies.

      The information is not appropriate for, and is not to be used as, a geodetic, legal, or engineering base. The information has no legal basis in the definition of boundaries or property lines and is not intended as a substitute for surveyed locations such as can be determined by a registered Public Land Surveyor.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Attributes are as recorded in the ISGS Wells and Borings database as of the noted date of extraction.  Attributes are collected from well permits and reports.  The information contained in these permits and reports is not verified by the ISGS.

      Refer also to the Disclaimer of Warranties and Accuracy of Data section of the Legal Notices of Terms and Conditions section of the University of Illinois Web Privacy Policy.  A link is provided in the Cross References section.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Some points occur at the origin of coordinate space.  These are points for which a real location cannot be determined.  For example, they may have an erroneous or non-existent legal description.
  Completeness_Report:
    All non-confidential point locations in the ISGS Wells and Borings database are included.  It is likely there are existing wells and borings that are not included in the ISGS Wells and Borings database, for example, those not reported, those placed prior to a regulatory reporting requirement, and those not subject to a regulatory reporting requirement.

    The data are exported to a shapefile weekly from the Wells and Borings (source) database for Internet distribution.  The source database is updated daily.  Thus, there may be recent updates (last 7 days) in the source database that are not reflected in the shapefile.
