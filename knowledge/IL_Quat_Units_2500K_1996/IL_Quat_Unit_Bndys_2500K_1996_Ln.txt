  Description:
    Abstract: This feature dataset is a generalized version of Quaternary Deposits of Illinois.  Updated to reflect the areal distribution of the Wedron and Mason Groups (Wisconsin and Hudson Episodes) and deposits of the Illinoian and pre-Illinoian episodes in Illinois as described in ISGS Bulletin 104.  Episodes are diachronic temporal units. Refer to the primary sources for more information. Scale is 1:2,500,000.
    Purpose:
      This data set was designed to be a generalized statewide coverage suitable for use in page-sized figures (8.5 x 11 inches).

      THIS DATA SET DOES NOT REPLACE the Quaternary Geology map of 1979.

      Information contained in this data set is more generalized than the 1979 version.  While the 1979 version is more detailed, it lacks recent updates to the lithostratigraphic reclassification of units which have been added to this 1996 version.  These updates primarily affect Wisconsin materials in north eastern Illinois.

      The data are not appropriate as a geodetic, legal or engineering base.  The data set was not and is not intended as a substitute for surveyed locations, such as can be determined by a registered Public Land Surveyor.  Although useful in a GIS as a reference base layer for maps, the data set has no legal basis in the definition of boundaries or property lines.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Recent updates to the data:

      In April 2004 edition 1.0 of the data set was transitioned to storage in an Oracle RDBMS using the ArcSDE geodatabase model.  The result (this version) is designated Edition 20040422.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Polygon attributes have not been individually verified.  The figure produced from this data set was included in the Hansel and Johnson, 1996 publication, which underwent the standard ISGS Bulletin peer review process.  Maps produced with these data are problematic, as they present a generalized view of Quaternary Deposits in Illinois that include some newly designated units but eliminate a great deal of valid details.  The planned revisions will address this issue.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Polygon and chain-node topology was present when the dataset was in coverage form.  This data set was checked for complete chain-node topology (no dangling arcs, except where appropriate), polygon labels (one per polygon, except for universal polygon), boundary values appropriate for map projection and map units, and appropriate "fuzzy" tolerances.  There are no known arc or polygon attribute values outside the appropriate value domains.
  Completeness_Report: This data set was created by merging the digital information provided by the MORAINES and QUAT79 data sets.  (The dataset refered to as QUAT79 was transitioned into SDE in 200404.  It is now known as GISDB_QTGEO.IL_Quat_Geology_500K_1979_Py.  The same applied to MORAINES.  It is now known as GISDB_QTGEO.IL_Moraines_Py.)  Many valid polygons from the source GIS data set (QUAT79) were eliminated due to generalization.  The Harrisville, Temperance Hill, and Atkinson moraines from the MORAINES data set were not included as they may not be Wisconsinan in age, but rather, may represent earlier periods of glaciation.  These data represent the generalized interpretations of ISGS geologists, based on data available in 1996.  Users of these data should consult Hansel and Johnson, ISGS Bulletin 104 (1996) for a complete description of the relationship between the data and the actual ground condition.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The horizontal positional accuracy of these data is dependent on that of the source data sets.  Positional accuracy reports from those data sets are reproduced here.

        For QUAT79:  This coverage was generated by Environmental Systems Research Institute as one component of a multi-layer Integrated Terrain Unit (ITU) database.  Automation was limited to polygons with area of one square mile or greater and linear features greater than one-half mile in width.  Boundaries which were generally coincident with boundaries of other ITU layers (e.g., soil associations or surface water bodies) may have been adjusted to be exactly coincident.  Overlay with the published map shows significant differences in some areas.  This data can only be used to show the generalized Quaternary boundaries within Illinois.

        For MORAINES:  Horizontal positional accuracy was verified in October, 1991 by manual overlay of source and hard-copy plots.  Lines within one line-width of the source were deemed acceptable.  Accuracy of the source with respect to the ground condition was not addressed in this review.  Consult the source for such information.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Quaternary deposits and stratigraphy data from the two source data sets were reformatted and regrouped to reflect Quaternary materials according to Hansel and Johnson, 1996.  Updates focused on Wisconsinan materials in the north eastern portion of the state.  There were essentially no changes made to Illinoian materials.

        GIS processing followed these basic steps:
        1) Union of MORAINES and QUAT79
        2) resel for codes that were moraines
        3) group these according to parent material
      Process_Date: 1995
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Source coverage (quat96) converted to double precision and reprojected to GCS_NAD83 using Workstation ArcInfo 7.2.1.

        The features were imported into the ISGS SDE enterprise database  following steps outlined in ISGS procedure GISDB_0009.
